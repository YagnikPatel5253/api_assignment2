    "\n",
    "1) Handling clean and user-friendly URLs: redirect() is useful for redirecting users from URL patterns that have changed or providing them with more user-friendly URLs. For example, if a user visits an outdated URL, the server can use redirect() to redirect them to the new, updated URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Handling conditional redirects: Based on certain conditions or business logic, the server may need to redirect the user to different pages or URLs. By using redirect(), the server can dynamically determine the appropriate destination based on the current context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Handling authentication and authorization: When implementing authentication and authorization systems, redirecting the user to specific pages based on their access privileges is common. For instance, if a user tries to access a protected resource without being logged in, the server can redirect them to a login page using redirect()."
